P5P iPad/iPhone App
-------------------
P5P is a collection of generative sketches. The interactive visuals are each defined by a flexible set of rules and computed by randomly modified algorithms. Adjust and tweak their parameters, touch or move the device to influence the outcome of the generated images. Save, print, email or publish screenshots.
